# crossmint-challenge

## Description
I thought the solution as follows:
1. Retrieve the goal map
2. Process the goal map to create the positions to build the map
3. Send the positions

I implemented the map clean feature, too.

I used the following technologies:
- NodeJS
- Express
- Typescript
- Fetch API

I used interfaces and extension.
I used the `fetch` API to make the requests.

I used the `async/await` pattern.

I needed to add some delays betwee DELETE and POST requests to ensure entities were actually deleted or created.

## How to run
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Use the Postman collection to test the API
